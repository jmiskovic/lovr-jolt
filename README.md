# lovr-jolt

This is a [LÃ–VR](https://lovr.org) plugin that integrates [Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) engine. It aims to replace the lovr's built-in ODE physics engine, with the same API.

Lua can work with C more easily than C++, so the [JoltPhysicsC](https://github.com/michal-z/zig-gamedev/tree/main/libs/zphysics/libs) binding is chosen to interface the Jolt core.

Not useable yet.
